the deep ocean in the latest edition of US CLIVAR
[Variations](https://indd.adobe.com/view/9de429e4-9c55-47f7-9ba2-59e1aeee5c92),
called "A case for observing the deep ocean." This edition of
Variations highlights the existing “state-of-the-art” methods to measure
the deep ocean, some of the scientific insights that have already been
gained from these observations, and new methodologies and technologies
to expand the network of observations. The GO-SHIP article begins on p.
