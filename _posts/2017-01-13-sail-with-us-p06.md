Greetings,

We are looking for students to participate in hydrographic long-line cruises (1-2 months) this coming summer (2017) in the South Pacific on the RVIB N.B. Palmer of the US Antarctic Program (USAP).
The US GO-SHIP program (formerly “US Repeat Hydrography”) collects data for global CO2 and climate variability programs.
The website is [https://usgoship.ucsd.edu](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu).

**Deadline for applications (see below for details): February 15, 2017**
<!--more-->

SIO operates the NSF-funded portion of the US national program.
The web-site of the international GO-SHIP (Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program) program is [http://go-ship.org](http://go-ship.org).

The program pays all travel costs.
It also pays student support costs during the time of the cruise plus the few travel days before and after the cruise, if the student is enrolled at a U.S. institution.

There are 2 legs on USAP’s RVIB Palmer in the South Pacific along the P6 line (30°S).
For each leg we are seeking 4 students for CTD/deck operations (typically PO background), and 1 student to help with CFC analysis (typically chemistry background), so a total of 10 students.

**Leg 1 (P6W): Sydney (Australia) – Papeete (Tahiti), 2017-07-03/2017-08-17**<br>
Sabine Mecking (UW) chief scientist (mecking@uw.edu)

**Leg 2 (P6E): Papeete (Tahiti) – Valparaiso (Chile), 2017-08-20/2017-09-30**<br>
Kevin Speer (FSU) chief scientist (kspeer@fsu.edu)

Note that dates and ports can change during final ship scheduling.

A valid passport and appropriate visa are required for participation in the cruises. U.S. citizenship is not required.

If you have any interest:

1. CTD students: Please e-mail Lynne Talley (ltalley@ucsd.edu) - co-chair U.S. GO-SHIP Executive Council, or the chief scientists of the cruise if you are interested for more information.

   CFC students: Please contact Rana Fine (rfine@rsmas.miami.edu) or Dong-Ha Min (dongha@austin.utexas.edu) – CFC PIs for P6
2. Talk to your advisor to be sure that this will work with your program.
3. After that, if you want to proceed - please send a cover letter indicating your interest and information about your background (CV, include the academic program you are part of, who your advisor is, what kind of research you are carrying out if you are at that stage, any prior cruise experience).

**Deadline for applications:  February 15, 2017**

Graduate students in good standing at US institutions will be given preference.
Undergraduates and postdocs (though only student salary covered) may apply too.

Duties:

The repeat hydrography cruises operate 24/7 with 12-hour shifts.
CTD student duties include operating the CTD and rosette bottle system both on deck and in the lab, drawing and documenting water samples, and working on data quality control and analysis alongside the chief and co-chief scientists.
You may also be asked to assist other science groups and to contribute to the cruise blogs.
CFC students will collect CFC samples and perform onboard CFC analysis as part of the CFC science team.

This is a great opportunity to get out to sea, participate in collecting hydrographic data down to the bottom of the ocean at the very highest reference standards of accuracy, to get started or continue looking at phenomena that interest you.
It will be an interesting and useful experience whether or not you've got experience at sea thus far, and we encourage any of you to consider coming along.
