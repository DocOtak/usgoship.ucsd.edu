Students
--------
Participate in each hydrographic long-line cruise (1-2 months).
For each leg we seek 2 to 4 students for CTD/deck operations,  1 student to assist with CFC analysis (typically laboratory chemistry background), and 1 student to assist with LADCP operations (typically physical oceanography background). 
Graduate students at US institutions are given preference.
Undergraduates and postdocs (though only student salary covered) may apply too.
The program pays all travel costs, and also support costs for students from US institutions during the time of the cruise plus travel days before and after the cruise.

Co-chief Scientists
-------------------
Advertisements for these positions will be circulated 6 to 9 months prior to each cruise.
 These positions are considered stepping-stones to the chief scientist position.
 They are open to those with PhDs or equivalent experience.
 No at sea experience is necessary, although it can be a plus.
 The Chief Scientist will provide training on board.
 Although preference may be given to those with ongoing research in the cruise region, all are welcome to apply.
 If there are multiple qualified applicants for these positions, final selection will be made by the U.S. GO-SHIP Executive Council, in consultation with the Chief Scientists and Principal Investigators.
 The program pays all travel costs, and support costs for several weeks before and after the cruise, and can provide costs for publications based from the cruise data.

Chief Scientists
----------------
Positions for upcoming US GO-SHIP cruises through 2019 are available.
See the [Cruise Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cruise-data-and-schedule.md %}).
The chief scientist will have had prior experience as a GO-SHIP Chief Scientist or Co-Chief Scientist, or equivalent sea-going responsibilities.
Chief Scientists on NOAA-funded cruises should generally be NOAA employees or contractors.
Contact U.S. GO-SHIP co-chairs [Gregory Johnson][] or [Lynne Talley][].

Postdoctoral Fellowships
------------------------
Fellowships foster participation in analysis and collection of GO-SHIP data.
The postdoc fellow can be resident at the institution of any U.S. GO-SHIP principal investigator during the fellowship.
The one-year fellowships are administered financially through the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
Fellows serve as co-chief scientist on one leg of a U.S. GO-SHIP cruise during their fellowship.

New Measurements
----------------
Proposals to US funding agencies for additional ('Level 3') measurements that take advantage of the core (Level 1 and 2) measurements are encouraged.
US GO-SHIP should be consulted in advance of such proposals to see if the measurements can be accommodated, including wire time, laboratory space, and berths.
Data management is subject to the policies that apply to all Level 3 data.
Requests for additional shiptime are sensitive and cannot necessarily be accommodated because of the impact on costs for all members of the scientific party.
