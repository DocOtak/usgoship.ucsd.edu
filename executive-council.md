Contact the committee co-chairs (Gregory C. Johnson and Lynne Talley)
for information on participation or for incorporation of a Level 3
measurement or a measurement that is not on the list of Core
Measurements.

Jim Swift assists the committee with coordination of program activities
carried out by US academic institutions, such as ship-time requests for
non-NOAA ships, pre-cruise information and logistics, organization of
the shipboard physical oceanography team, and oversight of data
reporting.
