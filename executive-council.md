The oversight committee for the US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat
Hydrography Program sees that the joint program of repeat hydrography,
ocean carbon, and tracer measurements is completed to fulfill the
scientific objectives of the program. The committee makes
recommendations on the sequence and coverage of the transects and
oversees any needed changes. They select a chief scientist, co-chief
scientist and 2-5 graduate students per cruise through community-wide
solicitations, and ensure that the core measurements are adequately and
consistently covered by the measurement teams for each cruise. They also
make recommendations regarding proposed add-on (Level 3) measurements;
for example, considering the requirements for extra ship time, berths,
and the seawater sample volume available for analyses. They ensure
smooth interactions with funding agencies and individual investigators,
and help see that adequate support is provided for the data management
structures. They serve as contact for coordinating with other national
and international efforts, and coordinate with CLIVAR and Carbon program
steering committees. They oversee pre-cruise planning, data submission,
and documentation, and work to ensure succession by entrainment of new
scientists into the program.

Contact the committee co-chairs (Gregory C. Johnson and Lynne Talley)
for information on participation or for incorporation of a Level 3
measurement or a measurement that is not on the list of Core
Measurements.

Jim Swift assists the committee with coordination of program activities
carried out by US academic institutions, such as ship-time requests for
non-NOAA ships, pre-cruise information and logistics, organization of
the shipboard physical oceanography team, and oversight of data
reporting.
